            <p className="doc-paras">Modals are dynamic UI components that overlay the main content of a web or app interface, providing focused interactions and supplementary information. These temporary windows or dialogs are often used for tasks like displaying detailed content, collecting user input, or presenting alerts. Modals typically appear centered on the screen and dim the background, drawing the user's attention to the modal's content. They offer a non-disruptive way to engage users without navigating away from the current context. Modals are a versatile tool for enhancing user interactivity and conveying critical information or actions within a compact and visually impactful space.</p>
